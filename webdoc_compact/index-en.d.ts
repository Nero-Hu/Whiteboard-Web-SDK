 *
 *   **Note**
 *   - This property must has the same value as the data center of the live
 * Interactive Whiteboard room to be joined; otherwise, the SDK fails to connect to the room.
 *   - You can set either this property or the `region` property in
 * {@link WhiteWebSdkConfiguration} to set the data center. If you set both,
 * this property overrides the `region` in `WhiteWebSdkConfiguration`.
 * - **roomToken**: *string*
 *
 *   The Room Token for user authentication. See [Token overview](https://docs.agora.io/en/whiteboard/whiteboard_token_overview?platform=Android).
 * - **userPayload?**: *{[key: string]: any;}*
 *
 *   Customized user information. This property can use any data type.
 *
 *   Refer to the following code to enable other users to read the `userPayload`
 * of a specific user, which is set when the user joins the room:
 *
 *   @example
 *   ```javascript
 *   for (var member of room.state.roomMembers) {
 *       console.log(member.userPayload);
 *   }
 *   ```
 * - **isWritable?**: *boolean*
 *
 *    Sets whether the user is in interactive mode in the room.
 *    - `true`： (Default) The user is in interactive mode (has read and write permissions on the whiteboard).
 *    - `false`：The user is in subscription mode (has read-only access to the whiteboard).
 *
 *    This method is different from `disableDeviceInputs`. See [Prohibited operation](https://developer.netless.link/javascript-en/home/disable#Read-only-mode).
 * - **disableDeviceInputs?**: *boolean*
 *
 *    Whether to disable the user from operating the whiteboard tools through the mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen:
 *    - `true`： Disable the user from operating the whiteboard tools.
 *    - `false`：(Default) Enable the user to operate the whiteboard tools.
 *
 *    This method is different from `isWritable`. See [Prohibited operation](https://developer.netless.link/javascript-en/home/disable#Prohibit-device-operation).
 * - **enableDrawPoint?**: *boolean*
 *
 *   Whether to enable the pen tool (`pencil`) to draw a point:
 *   - `true`： Enable the pen tool to draw a point.
 *   - `false`：(Default) Disable the pen tool from drawing a point. In this case,
 * clicking on the whiteboard with the pen tool does not draw a point on the screen.
 *
 *   **Note**
 *
 *   This property takes effect only when `disableNewPencil` is set to `false`.
 *
 * - **disableNewPencil?**: *boolean*
 *
 *   **Since 2.12.5**
 *
 *   Disables/Enables the stroke effect of the pencil.
 *   - `true`: (Default) Disable the stroke effect of the pencil.
 *   - `false`: Enable the stroke effect of the pencil.
 *
 *  **Note**
 *
 *   To enable the stroke effect, ensure that every user in the room uses one of the following SDKs:
 *      - Android SDK 2.12.3 or later
 *      - iOS SDK 2.12.3 or later
 *      - Web SDK 2.12.5 or later
 *
 * - **disableMagixEventDispatchLimit?**: *boolean*
 *
 *   **Since v2.15.0**
 *
 *   Whether to disable the frequency limit for sending custom events:
 *   - `true`: Disable the frequency limit. When the frequency limit is disabled, freezes may occur.
 *   - `false`: (Default) Enable the frequency limit. When the frequency limit is enabled, the SDK sends an event every 75 ms.
 *
 * - **disableEraseImage?**: *boolean*
 *
 *    Whether to disable the eraser from erasing images on the whiteboard:
 *    - `true`：Disable the eraser from erasing images.
 *    - `false`：(Default) Enable the eraser to erase images.
 *
 * - **disablePencilWrittingLimitFrequency**?: *boolean*
 *
 *   **Since v2.15.2**
 *
 *   Whether to disable the frequency limit for synchronizing the writing input while using the `pencil` tool:
 *   - `true`: Disable the frequency limit. When the frequency limit is disabled, the writing is synchronized immediately, but CPU consumption can increase.
 *   - `false`: (Default) Enable the frequency limit. When the frequency limit is enabled, the writing synchronization can
 *   be slightly delayed, but CPU consumption is lessened.
 *
 * - **floatBar?**: *boolean | Partial<FloatBarOptions>*
 *
 *    Whether to enable the floating bar when `currentApplianceName` is set to `selector`
 * or `text`:
 *     - `true`： Enable the floating bar.
 *     - `false`：(Default) Disable the floating bar.
 *
 * - **hotKeys?**: *Partial<HotKeys>*
 *
 *   Add custom hotkeys. If you do not set this property, the SDK uses the
 * following default hotkeys:
 *
 *   | Keys              | Action                     |
 *   | :--------------------- | :---------------------- |
 *   | Backspace or Delete     | Delete the selected object            |

 *
 *   To disable the default hotkeys, set this property as `{}`.
 * - **rejectWhenReadonlyErrorLevel?**: *RoomErrorLevel*
